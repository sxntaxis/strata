# NOW — Strata

## Current phase

ARCH-001 has been completed. The post-SQLite issue reconciliation program is complete, and the current runtime is SQLite-only. The v0.7.7 direct interaction model is reconciled onto that authority.

The certified system includes:

- fail-closed profile-bound SQLite runtime persistence with one current schema;
- monotonic/UTC/fixed-offset time and exact operational-day allocation;
- canonical category/layer, session, active-generation, and report identity;
- conserved sediment, bounded recovery, immutable historical artifacts, and revision-matched daily contributions;
- receipt-governed switch/finish/reset transitions plus atomic receipt-free clear-all;
- active/archived category integrity with stable archive/restore identity;
- explicit report editing, truthful keymap/palette/atlas routing, and exactly-once terminal restoration;
- session-owned active description drafts separated from durable category metadata and reusable tags;
- one process-bound profile UUID owning complete data, state, configuration, recovery, and SQLite paths;
- profile-scoped live CLI-to-TUI control with short-path and long-path socket publication recovery;
- responsive monotonic sediment canvas expansion with conservation;
- real process proofs for profile isolation, copied-artifact refusal, persistence failure, live control, and PTY restoration.

The transitional CSV/JSON runtime, authority selection, activation ceremony, and historical schema
upgrade chain are retired. Portable bundle export/import and SQLite doctor, backup, and restore remain
product functionality. Runtime recovery, checkpoints, receipts, categories, sessions, and sediment are
SQLite-owned.

The independent `project` axis and speculative category merge/permanent-delete lifecycle are retired.
Clear-all is receipt-free and atomic. Switch, finish, and reset receipts remain only for their real
runtime/checkpoint failure boundary. Final native validation passed formatting, strict Clippy, the full
test suite, build, help smoke, diff hygiene, and the long-profile dangling-symlink runtime proof.

## Verified final baseline

- final native HEAD is `950c98b4f4196aa1bc932618850a83d110a57351`;
- formatting, strict Clippy, full tests, build, help smoke, and diff hygiene pass;
- fresh-profile direct-SQLite and profile-isolation proofs pass;
- short-path active-socket refusal and long-path live-control proofs pass;
- dangling long-path publication cleanup passes across a real TUI restart.

## Certification evidence

- current schema initializes fresh databases transactionally at `user_version = 1` and rejects other development versions;
- strict storage-authority residue search is empty outside the authoritative decision record;
- formatting, strict Clippy, tests, fresh-profile smoke proof, help output, diff hygiene, and final long-path IPC runtime certification were run for the reconciled baseline.

## Known non-blocking questions

The accepted implementation does not settle every possible future product direction. Remaining design questions include vertical chronology, optional category relationships, final Karma terminology, future sediment clearing/formation semantics, zoom/compression/panning, configurable quantum migration, possible IANA timezone support, and any future stable identity for queued cross-authority mutation replay.

These are not open implementation defects. They require new evidence and an explicit future unit before constraining the current system.

## Next

Preserve the certified baseline. New work begins only from a newly justified issue, decision, or architecture unit; superseded issue premises remain in Git history rather than current authority.
